      I was a member of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/outlook-mobile-for-android-and-ios/">Outlook for iOS</a> team. I focused on security, navigation, design systems, and build systems.

      Notably, I led engineering on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18125281/microsoft-outlook-design-update-ios-iphone/">redesign</a> of the app, work that was then bundled and integrated by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996748/microsoft-fluent-design-mobile-office-apps-new-updates-features/">company</a> as a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent">universal design system</a>.

    <h1>Open source</h1>

      I author and contribute to tools that others can use to build their software, most of which is <a href="https://github.com/qasim">open source</a>.

      What started as a library of <a href="https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/uoft-scrapers">web scrapers</a> for the University of Toronto later became a collection of <a href="https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/cobalt">web APIs</a> for interfacing with the university's public data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the university itself was not ready to fund something like Cobalt, I was fortunate enough to partner with a <a href="https://www.thinkdataworks.com/">local open data company</a> that sponsored the project for its lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote about my original motivation for Cobalt in a <a href="/cobalt-and-the-case-for-open-data/">blog post</a>.
