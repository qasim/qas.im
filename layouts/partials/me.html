      I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_Canadians">Pakistani Canadian</a> living in the city of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toronto,+ON">Toronto</a>.

    <h1>Work</h1>
    <p>
      To make my living, I plan and write software at organizations.

    <p>
      I originally joined Double to rewrite two iOS apps from scratch with a newly formed team, responsible for things such as project structure, app architecture, and a build system.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now actively maintain the apps and build new features weekly as we continue to grow.

    <p>
      I was a member of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/outlook-mobile-for-android-and-ios/">Outlook for iOS</a> team, responsible for many of the project's core pieces including authentication, security, navigation, shareable UI components, best practices and guidelines, and a comprehensive build system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notably, I led engineering on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18125281/microsoft-outlook-design-update-ios-iphone/">major redesign</a> of the app, work that was later shared and implemented across the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996748/microsoft-fluent-design-mobile-office-apps-new-updates-features/">entire company</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw our team grow from eight engineers to over thirty, and built many of my foundations on what teamwork at the workplace looks like during my time there.
    </p>
    <h1>Open source</h1>
    <p>
      I author and contribute to tools that others can use to build their software, most of which is <a href="https://github.com/qasim">open source</a>.

    <p>
      What started out as a library of <a href="https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/uoft-scrapers">web scrapers</a> for the University of Toronto eventually became a collection of <a href="https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/cobalt">web APIs</a> for interfacing with the university's public data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the university itself was not ready to fund something like Cobalt, I was fortunate enough to partner with a <a href="https://www.thinkdataworks.com/">local open data startup</a> that sponsored the project for its lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote about my original motivation for Cobalt in a <a href="/cobalt-and-the-case-for-open-data/">blog post</a>.
