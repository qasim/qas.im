      I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_Canadians">Pakistani Canadian</a> living in the city of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toronto,+ON">Toronto</a>.

    <h1>Work</h1>
    <p>
      To make my living, I plan and write software at organizations.

      <div class="date">January 2020 － February 2021</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      At Double, I helped rewrite their iOS apps from scratch, responsible for building up a project structure, app architecture, and build system.

      <div class="date">May 2016 － December 2019</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      I was a member of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/outlook-mobile-for-android-and-ios/">Outlook for iOS</a> team, responsible for many of the project's core pieces including security, navigation, a design system, and a comprehensive build system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notably, I led engineering on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18125281/microsoft-outlook-design-update-ios-iphone/">major redesign</a> of the app, work that was later bundled and shared across the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996748/microsoft-fluent-design-mobile-office-apps-new-updates-features/">entire company</a> as a universal design system.
    </p>
    <h1>Open source</h1>
    <p>
      I author and contribute to tools that others can use to build their software, most of which is <a href="https://github.com/qasim">open source</a>.

    <p>
      What started out as a library of <a href="https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/uoft-scrapers">web scrapers</a> for the University of Toronto eventually became a collection of <a href="https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/cobalt">web APIs</a> for interfacing with the university's public data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the university itself was not ready to fund something like Cobalt, I was fortunate enough to partner with a <a href="https://www.thinkdataworks.com/">local open data company</a> that sponsored the project for its lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote about my original motivation for Cobalt in a <a href="/cobalt-and-the-case-for-open-data/">blog post</a>.
