Father arrived home after his surgery this weekend. I took him for a walk around the block to help him get back to moving around again.

"In Leeds, when you were 2 years old, I had just arrived home after my first surgery," he explained, imitating a penguin’s waddle, "I was barely able to move."

"We went on a walk together then too. You had your whole hand wrapped around my finger while we went up and down Ashley Road."

"You must have thought that I was the one walking you," he laughs as he recalls the memory.

"It was **_you_** who was walking me then, and it’s **_you_** who is walking me now."
