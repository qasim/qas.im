Yeah, I'm starting a blog. I want this to be a place where I can discuss cool topics related to software development and computer science in general. Even more than that, I want this to be a place where you can read about my personal reflections on things I care about.

### And you are...?

I'm a 19 year old software developer from Toronto, Canada. I'm working towards an undergraduate degree in computer science from the University of Toronto, where I'm also the web dude for our [Computer Science Student Union](http://cssu.ca) and [UofTHacks](http://uofthacks.com). It's seriously been a great time so far.

I spent summer 2015 interning at [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com) with the wonderful OneNote for Apple platforms team, and I'm lining up some awesome things for summer 2016 to follow with that. More on what that means soon!

Aside from school and work, I am a huge fan of open source software and open data. I've been trying to foster a culture of open data at UofT, channeling all of my energy into a new project called [Cobalt](http://cobalt.qas.im), a collection of open data web APIs with the goal of empowering developers to use UofT campus data to build cool things.

Thanks for stopping by! Until next time.
