Yeah, I'm starting a blog. I want this to be a place where I can discuss cool topics related to software development and computer science in general. Even more than that, I want this to be a place where you can read about my personal reflections on things I care about.

### And you are...?

I'm a 19 year old software developer from Toronto, Canada. I'm completing an undergraduate degree in computer science from the University of Toronto, where I'm also the web dude for our <a href="http://cssu.ca" target="blank">Computer Science Student Union</a>. It's seriously been a great time so far.

I spent this past summer at <a href="http://microsoft.com" target="blank">Microsoft</a>'s OneNote for Apple platforms team, where I worked on designing and building their native share extensions, among many other things I got my hands on.

Aside from school and work, I am a huge fan of open source software and open data. I've been trying to foster a culture of open data at the University of Toronto, channeling all of my energy into a new project called <a href="http://cobalt.qas.im" target="blank">Cobalt</a>, a collection of open data web APIs with the goal of empowering developers to use campus data to build cool things.

Thanks for stopping by! Until next time.
