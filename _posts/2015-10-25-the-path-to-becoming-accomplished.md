I recently watched a talk given a few years ago by <a href="https://twitter.com/chadfowler" target="blank">Chad Fowler</a> (the man leading Wunderlist at Microsoft, among many other things) on how to become accomplished. I found a lot of what he mentioned very interesting and wanted to talk about and reflect on a few of the key points that resonated with me.

As software developers, we're very good at working with complex systems, so much so that our brains even take the initiative to find patterns and create abstractions for real life topics such as our career, health, or personal relationships. This is very fascinating because we're able to take the *same* work we do as developers (organizing, implementing and modifying things, iterating on failure) and use it to progressively shape better versions of ourselves.

What steps can we start taking today to turn ourselves into more performant and accomplished individuals?

### Ask yourself: Why am I doing this?

Whenever you're embarking on something new, or even as you continue to progress with something, ask yourself: *"Why am I doing this?"*. Is there a strategic value in what you're doing?

If there is a strong purpose in what you're trying to do, you'll maintain a greater level of motivation to continue doing it. Otherwise, will you really be producing your best work if you're unsure whether what you're doing is actually worth your time?

### Take advantage of your free time

Every day there's some new concept or a new technology that you overhear from someone or see online. Of course you immediately tell yourself that you need to learn this, but on almost every occasion you don't actually get around to it. The thought is lost indefinitely until the next time something reminds you of it.

You can fix this problem by keeping a list of things you want to learn and update it as you find more of them. Then, the next time you're on a bus or a plane with some time to kill, open up some resources on the subject and make it your mission to grasp it. This lets you maximize every moment of your day, even during what would otherwise be known as "free time".

### Treat passion as a resource

Passion can be seen as a resource that burns faster than it can renew. For example: before the school year even starts, it's so easy to think to yourself that you're going to work incredibly hard on all your subjects and you'll be doing your homework every single day.

For me, more often than not, the school work I'm doing isn't something that's generously replenishing my passion. As soon as the semester actually does begin, I start to lose the motivation I originally had and can sense my passion towards school beginning to drain. I'm running the resource to a point where it can't keep up, leading me to fall back to bad habits from the year before.

How can you prevent something like this from happening? *Seek out and do things that you're genuinely passionate about*. Don't allow yourself too long a period doing tasks with no true motivation.

### Final words

The path to becoming accomplished isn't clear-cut. Take the appropriate steps towards maximizing your time and energy into things you truly care about, and great accomplishments will follow as you move forward in your career.

If any of these ideas intrigued you, I highly recommend watching the whole talk by Chad Fowler <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsIcFf9pnCo" target="blank">here</a>.
